## From the Developer:

This Android App is developed by <a target="_blank" href="https://siddydevelops.github.io/">Siddharth Singh<a/>. The vector-icons and images used while designing this app is taken from various websites including <a target="_blank" href="https://icons8.com/">Icons-8<a/>. Hence I do not own these icons.
